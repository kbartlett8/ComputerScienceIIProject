# Java Project
LPh Emma Rhode
This project was developed as part of my Computer Science II course. It involved designing and implementing a Java-backed database system for a simulated company. 
I collaborated with a classmate, Emma Rhode, to build and test the backend infrastructure, applying object-oriented programming principles and database integration techniques to create a functional prototype.
